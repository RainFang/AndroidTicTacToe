About this project:

This was a homework assignment during my CS 371M Mobile Computing class. The assignment was to make a Tic-Tac-Toe application for the Android OS.

It currently only supports human vs AI, so I decided to run with that and create a Terminator theme for this app, complete with custom icons and sounds.

Featured in this project is:
-Human vs AI in tic-tac-toe
-New game
-First move alternation
-Difficulty adjustment
-Action bar options
-Icons
-scoreboard
-Quit Game
-Terminator theme and icons
-Sound effects

Things to add next:
-cosmetic improvements (such as the action bar icons)
-Find a way to remove the app title from the action bar, so I can place more action bar icons
-Find ways to make more use of a smartphone's features
