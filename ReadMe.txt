About this project:

This was a homework assignment during my CS 371M Mobile Computing class. The assignment was to make a Tic-Tac-Toe application for the Android OS.

It currently only supports human vs AI, so I decided to run with that and create a Terminator theme for this app, complete with custom icons and sounds.

And yes, those action bar icons are My Little Ponies.

Featured in this project is:
-Landscape mode support (NEW)
-Keeping the game state intact from orientation changes (NEW)
-Keeping the game score saved from user exits (NEW)
-Reset scores (NEW)
-My Little Ponies action bar icons! (NEW)
-Human vs AI in tic-tac-toe
-New game
-First move alternation
-Difficulty adjustment
-Icons
-scoreboard
-Quit Game
-Terminator theme and icons
-Sound effects

Things to add next:
-Find ways to make more use of a smartphone's features
-User exits is only saving score. It needs to also save the current board as well. Only orientation changes is keeping the current board saved.
-Duplicate the action bar on the menu button. It is more intuitive than pony icons.
